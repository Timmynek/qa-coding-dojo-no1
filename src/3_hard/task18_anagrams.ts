/**
 * Task 18: ðŸ”´ Group Anagrams (20-25 min)
 * 
 * Implement a function that groups anagrams together.
 * 
 * Requirements:
 * - Group words that are anagrams of each other
 * - Anagrams have the same letters in different order
 * - Return an array of arrays (each sub-array contains anagrams)
 * - Order of groups doesn't matter
 * 
 * Test cases:
 * - groupAnagrams(["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"])
 *   â†’ [["eat","tea","ate"], ["tan","nat"], ["bat"]]
 * 
 * Hint: Sort the letters of each word to find anagrams
